Sound2Sight 🎵➡️🖼 | Generating Images from Tamil Audio Input
📌 Overview
Sound2Sight is an AI-driven system that converts Tamil audio input into meaningful images. By integrating speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and AI-powered image generation, this project enables seamless multimodal transformation from spoken words to visual representations.

✨ Features
🎙️ Tamil Speech Recognition – Converts spoken Tamil words into text.

🧠 Natural Language Understanding – Analyzes and processes transcribed text.

🎨 AI-Powered Image Generation – Generates images based on detected keywords and context.

🚀 Real-Time Processing – Converts speech to images with minimal delay.

🌍 Multimodal AI – Combines speech, text, and image generation for an interactive experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack
